## About Me {#about}

I’m Eamon Byrne, PhD, a scientist and consultant with expertise in **protein engineering, gene therapy, cell-based therapeutics, and translational biotech**. I help startups, researchers, faculty and tech transfer offices transform their science into funded projects and real-world impact. Clients value my ability to combine **deep technical expertise** with **strategic insight** to craft winning proposals and commercialization strategies.

Trained at Oxford and Stanford and seasoned in San Francisco’s biotech startup ecosystem, I bring a global perspective, rigorous scientific training, and cross-sector experience spanning academia, startups, and industry — bridging the gap between discovery and commercialization.
